    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer</li>
        <li>Place flour in a large plastic bag depending on the amount of chicken you are cooking. Season flour with paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li>
        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. Let it sit until the flour is of a paste-like consistency</li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until very hot.</li>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in hot oil on both sides.</li>
        <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes. Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>

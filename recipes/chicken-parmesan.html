    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredeitns and preheat an oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit or 230 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface.</li>
        <li>Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set asid. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. COok chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <ll>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce.</ll>
        <li>Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit or 74 degrees Celsius.</li>
